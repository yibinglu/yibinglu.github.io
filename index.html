        <p>With each passing day, more and more dementors are "going on strike" as they continue to disappear from Azkaban. This has caused an uprise in the wizarding community because of the fear of prisoners escaping. The reason for the strike is unknown, however, the ministry is doing everything in its power to find and restore the dementors back to Azkaban where they belong. We ask that for the time being that no one goes out at night alone, especially underage wizards. Due to this issue, we would like to inform all parents that Hogwarts will now be teaching all students the Patronous Charm just in case one finds themselves in a situation where it is needed. Just a reminder that although underage wizards and witches are not permitted to use magic outside of school, exceptions will be made in the case of life-threatning situations.

        <h1>50th Anniversary of defeating You-Know-Who</h1>
        <p>50 years ago on this exact day, the most powerful dark wizard the world had ever seen was defeated by the one and only Harry Potter. Every year, we celebrate the peaceful world we now live in but we also mourn the loss of those that lost their lives fighting for our safety.</p>
